# Server Mod Disabler

**Warning: This feature is not working in 1.3.0 due to a file reading bug.**

If you go to `servers.txt`, you can edit which servers don't allow what module. It is not recommended to allow a server's mod that is disabled by default. I am still not responsible for any bans using this PVP client.
